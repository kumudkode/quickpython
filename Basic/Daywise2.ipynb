    "Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The primary conditional statements are `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if the condition is true\n",
    "elif another_condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if the another_condition is true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Advanced Conditional Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Nested Conditionals:**\n",
    "    *   You can nest `if` statements inside other `if` statements to create more complex decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 5\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        if y > 0:\n",
    "            print(\"Both x and y are positive\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"x is positive but y is not\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"x is not positive\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Chained Conditionals with Logical Operators:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    age = 25\n",
    "    if age > 18 and age < 60:\n",
    "        print(\"You are eligible to work\")\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "3.  **Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   A more concise way to write simple `if-else` statements in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    parity = \"even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"odd\"\n",
    "    print(f\"x is {parity}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`in` operator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Check if a value exists in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "    if \"red\" in colors:\n",
    "        print(\"Red is available\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Complex Conditional Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Combining multiple techniques for advanced control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Example: Checking if a number is within a specific range and also even\n",
    "    num = 24\n",
    "    lower_bound = 20\n",
    "    upper_bound = 30\n",

    "    if lower_bound <= num <= upper_bound and num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        print(f\"{num} is within the range {lower_bound}-{upper_bound} and is even.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"{num} does not meet the criteria.\")\n",
