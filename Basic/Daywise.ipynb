    "# Python: A Brief History and Future\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, using significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Milestones\n",
    "- **Python 1.0 (1994)**: Added functional programming tools like `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n",
    "- **Python 2.0 (2000)**: Introduced list comprehensions and a garbage collection system.\n",
    "- **Python 3.0 (2008)**: A major revision that is not fully backward-compatible. It addressed fundamental design flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future\n",
    "Python's future looks bright, with ongoing developments focusing on:\n",
    "- **Performance**: Projects like Pyston and efforts to optimize the CPython interpreter.\n",
    "- **Typing**: Gradual typing through features like type hints to improve code reliability.\n",
    "- **Web Development**: Frameworks like Django and Flask continue to evolve.\n",
    "- **Data Science and AI**: Libraries like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch remain central to these fields, with continuous updates and improvements.\n",
    "- **Async Programming**: Enhancements in `asyncio` to better support concurrent operations.\n",

    "# Day 2\n",
    "# Python has grown significantly since its creation in 1991.\n",
    "# Major additions and improvements over the years include:\n",
    "# - Introduction of functional programming tools (lambda, map, filter, reduce) in Python 1.0 (1994)\n",
    "# - List comprehensions and garbage collection in Python 2.0 (2000)\n",
    "# - Unicode support, new-style classes, and many syntax improvements in Python 2.x series\n",
    "# - Major redesign with Python 3.0 (2008): better Unicode handling, print as a function, integer division changes, and more\n",
    "# - Type hints and gradual typing (PEP 484 and beyond)\n",
    "# - Async programming with 'async' and 'await' keywords\n",
    "# - Performance improvements (e.g., Python 3.11+ is much faster than earlier versions)\n",
    "# - Rich ecosystem: data science (NumPy, pandas), web (Django, Flask), AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch), automation, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "# As of 2025, Python remains one of the most popular programming languages.\n",
    "# It is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, education, and scripting.\n",
    "# The language continues to evolve with new features, better performance, and improved developer experience.\n",
    "# The community and library ecosystem are stronger than ever, making Python a top choice for many domains."

    "# Difference Between `pip` and Module in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: `pip` is the package installer for Python.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: It is used to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library.\n",
    "- **Usage Example**:  \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install numpy\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Functionality**: Downloads packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and installs them into your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Module\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A module is a single Python file (`.py`) containing Python code (functions, classes, variables, etc.) that can be imported and used in other Python programs.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Helps organize and reuse code across multiple programs.\n",
    "- **Usage Example**:  \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import math\n",
    "    print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Functionality**: Can be part of the standard library, a third-party package (installed via `pip`), or your own custom code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**:  \n",
    "- `pip` is a tool for installing Python packages.\n",
    "- A module is a file containing Python code that can be imported and used in your scripts.  \n",
    "- You use `pip` to install packages, which may contain one or more modules."
